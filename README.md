Converting Stake bet slips (with bet selections, odds, markets, etc.) into equivalent bet codes or selections on other betting platforms—basically like a cross-platform bet translation.

A lot of users want to follow a tip or a slip someone shared on Stake, but they want to place the same bet on a different bookie—maybe due to better odds, regional availability, preferred UI, or bonuses.

A flow diagram mockup for Multibooker. It shows the journey from a Stake bet slip input to the generation of a matching bet code for another bookmaker: <a href="https://ibb.co/d4XBhqQZ"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/b5Y1fZrt/output.png" alt="output" border="0"></a>

User Input: User provides a Stake bet code.

Backend API: Receives the request and routes it.

Parser: Decodes and normalizes the bet slip.

Mapper: Translates bet formats into equivalent ones for other bookies.

API Adapters: Interfaces with external bookie APIs to generate valid codes.

Database: Stores match info, mappings, logs.

Frontend: Communicates with backend, displays inputs/outputs.

Output: Provides a valid, playable bet code on another platform.



✅ Here’s how we can tackle that in steps:
🧾 1. User Input
Input field for:

Stake bet URL (optional)

Screenshot upload (primary source)

🧠 2. OCR & Text Extraction
Use Tesseract OCR (via Python pytesseract) or an API like Google Vision to extract raw text from screenshots.

Preprocess the image:

Resize, grayscale, denoise, threshold

Crop modal area if possible (better OCR performance)

🔍 3. Pattern Matching / Parsing
Regex & NLP to identify:
Match (e.g. Baez, Sebastian - Cobolli, Flavio)
Market (e.g. To Win a Set)
Selection (e.g. Yes)
Odds (e.g. 1.22)

We'll use dictionaries + fuzzy matching to generalize naming

🧱 4. Normalize Output
Here’s what we aim to extract:

json
Copy
Edit
[
  {
    "match": "Baez, Sebastian vs Cobolli, Flavio",
    "market": "To Win a Set",
    "selection": "Baez, Sebastian",
    "odd": 1.22,
    "status": "live",
    "score": "3-5, 0-1"
  },
  {
    "match": "Royal Antwerp FC vs Club Brugge",
    "market": "Asian Total",
    "selection": "Over 2",
    "odd": 1.36,
    "status": "live",
    "minute": "49'"
  },
  {
    "match": "Go Ahead Eagles vs FC Utrecht",
    "market": "Asian Total",
    "selection": "Over 1.75",
    "odd": 1.25,
    "status": "live",
    "minute": "8'"
  }
]
🔁 5. Pass to Mapper Module
This structured data then gets mapped to other bookies’ formats.







3. Allow uploading multiple screenshots (advanced)
In future versions, users could upload multiple images, and you merge the parsed data.


💼 A Real-World Production App with:
🎯 Clean UX/UI — for slip uploads and conversion flow

💰 Monetization hooks — like in-app Ads

🔐 User accounts — login/registration for saved slips or premium features

🧠 Usage tracking — e.g., analytics or conversion logs
--------------------------------------------------------------
🧩 Let’s Break It into Phases:
✅ Phase 1: UI Polish (MVP Look & Flow)
Drag/drop upload zone or button

Loading spinner / progress feedback

Better error messages

Show mapped results with clear layout

Room for Ad banners (top, sidebar, or inline)

🛠️ Phase 2: Add Auth System
Basic Login/Register page

Use Firebase Auth or Supabase (easy, free, secure)

Store:

Email/password login

Save recent conversions (optional)

Restrict frequent usage if needed

💡 Why Auth Now?
If you plan to:

Monetize via usage limits or account tiers

Log and display past conversion history

Personalize ad experiences


UI:
🧱 Enhancements We Planned:
🔐 User Authentication (Login/Register)

📤 Support for Multi-image Uploads

📦 Session & History Tracking

💵 Ad Integration Placement

🧪 Improve Parsing Accuracy + More Market Types

📊 (Optional) Admin Panel or Analytics
